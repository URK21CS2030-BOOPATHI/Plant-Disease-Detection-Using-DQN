🌿 Plant Disease Detection and Treatment Recommendation System
This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Deep Q-Networks (DQN) hybrid approach to detect plant diseases from leaf images and recommend optimal treatment strategies. Designed for smart agriculture, the system helps farmers and agricultural experts make timely, data-driven decisions to protect crop health.

📌 Features
🔍 Accurate Plant Disease Detection using CNN with 98% accuracy

💡 AI-based Treatment Recommendation powered by Deep Q-Network (DQN)

🌱 Robust Image Preprocessing & Feature Extraction

🌐 User-Friendly Interface for image upload and result display using Streamlit

📊 Expandable Dataset & Scalable Architecture

🛰️ Future-ready: IoT & Mobile Integration support

🧠 Technologies Used
Python 3.x

TensorFlow / Pytorch

OpenCV (for preprocessing)

CNN (for image classification)

DQN (for reinforcement learning-based treatment suggestions)

Streamlit (for frontend UI)
